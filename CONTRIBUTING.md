* **Report a bug in code or documentation**

  Please file an issue describing the details of the problem.
  When reporting a bug in code, steps to reproduce the issue
  must be supplied.

* **Request a new feature**

  Pleae file an issue describing the new feature and label it
  as a `Feature Request`.

When a bug report or a feature request is received,

test cases and code examples in bug reports and feature requests._**

## Code contributions

### Sign your work

We require that all contributors sign-off on their commits.
This certifies that the contribution is your original work,
or you have the rights to submit it under the same license,
or a compatible license.

Any contribution which contains commits that are not signed off will not be accepted.

To sign off on a commit use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option
when committing your changes:

```shell
git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
```

This will append the following to your commit message:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
```

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the patch.
Your signature certifies that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right
to pass it on as an open-source patch.
Use your real name, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.
If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs,
you can sign your commit automatically with `git commit -s`.

The sign-off means you certify the below
(from [developercertificate.org](https://developercertificate.org)):
